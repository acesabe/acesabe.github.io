# Internet outage > 4g Hotspot!

Scenario:

Your home internet connection goes down (and it's not your computer/router - see last weeks Tech Tips notes for details) - what do you do?

If you have an Android or iPhone (or Windows phone even??) then you can use your phones 3/4g data connection and connect your work computer to the internet via your phone!

## How to connect your computer to your phones internet

-You will need to have a computer with Wifi so either a laptop or a desktop PC with a wifi card*

*Some phones support "tethering" via a USB cable instead but this is less common so not an option we need to explore here.


-A phone that supports wifi hotspot + a data connection/tarriff 

1/ Enable your hotspot on your phone:

This will vary depending on the phone and software version you have so you will need to find out how to do it on the device you have.

You should set a wifi hotspot name you will recognise and a password to ensure nobody else hops onto your hotspot!

2/Connect your computer to your wifi hotspot

Once your hotspot is enabled and your phone is in a good location to get the the mobile network signal and close to your computer, you just need to connect your computer to the wireless network you have just created, your "hotspot".

This is no different to connecting your computer to any other wireless network, open your wireless settings, scan for networks, select your hotspot network, when prompted enter your network password and that is it!

Bear in mind that your mobile data is probably not unlimited so try to make sure that you are not downloading large updates. streaming media or doing other high data activities or you may run out of data sooner than you expect (or get a rather large bill)

You only want to do this in an emergency as the connection may not be a good as via your home internet connection, especially for VCC voice calling, but presuming you have good mobile network cover where you are, this can work well as an emergency solution if needs must.
